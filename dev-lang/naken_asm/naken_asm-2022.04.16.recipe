SUMMARY="Lightweight assembler/disassembler, easy to compile and easy to use"
DESCRIPTION="naken_asm is a lightweight assembler/disassembler with a focus on being easy to \
compile (no dependencies) and easy to use. It was originally called naken430asm, but since it \
has been expanded it to support many more CPUs it has been renamed to naken_asm. Additionally, \
there is also a simulator for some of the supported CPUs."
